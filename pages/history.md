## How It All Began

**The Well Church**, formerly known as *Whitley Community Church*, was formed in the early 1990s after the "Jesus Lives in Whitley" tent outreach run by *King's Church*. The church used to meet in the Rabson's Room at the South Reading Leisure Centre but later moved to the Underwood Mission Hall in Dawlish Road.

## The Dawlish Road Story

The site in Dawlish Road has been home to a church for many years. *The Underwood Church*, being the first evangelical church on the Whitley estate, was named after Harvey Underwood who preached the gospel from the back of his van. The church saw many people in the Whitley area come to know Jesus during the "Back to God Campaign" in the 1970s.

## Growing Together

In January 2015 the church joined *Churches in Community International*.

In 2022, Rod and Elsa took on the role of pastoring The Well Church, bringing a renewed vision to reach the marginalised and see broken lives healed and hope restored.

Today, The Well Church is a thriving multicultural family — welcoming people from every background and nation, united in Christ. We continue to meet every Sunday at 10:30am on Dawlish Road, and our services are live-streamed on Facebook for friends around the world.
