## Sunday Morning Service

**Every Sunday at 10:30am**

Whether you are visiting for the first time or coming home, you are welcome. Our Sunday gathering is the heartbeat of our week — a time to worship together, hear from the Bible, pray, and encourage one another in faith.

Each week carries a different focus — from worship themes and character-building series to seasons of prayer and fasting. There is always something fresh happening, and every Sunday is a good Sunday to visit.

Services run for approximately 45 to 60 minutes.

## What to Expect

When you arrive you will be greeted warmly at the door. There are no expectations and no dress code — just come as you are.

A typical Sunday morning looks like this:

- **Worship** — We sing together, accompanied by piano, violin, flute, and other instruments. Worship is a real highlight of our Sundays.
- **Teaching** — A message from the Bible, rooted in Scripture and applied to everyday life. We are currently exploring themes of character, faith, and following Jesus.
- **Prayer** — We value prayer together. There is space during the service to pray and to be prayed for.
- **Fellowship** — After the service, we gather for tea, coffee, and conversation. Some of the best moments happen here.

## Watch Live Online

Can't make it in person? We live-stream every Sunday service on Facebook. You can join from anywhere in the world — and many do. Friends have tuned in from across the UK and from as far as Liberia, West Africa.

We are also working towards launching on YouTube — stay tuned.

## Children

We love welcoming families. Children's activities run during the Sunday service so that younger ones can learn and grow in a fun, safe environment while parents engage fully in the service. Please speak to one of our team when you arrive and we will get your children settled in.

## Serve on Sundays

There are practical ways to get involved and make a real difference every week.

### Join the Worship Team

We are looking for musicians to grow our Sunday worship band — especially a **bass player**. We currently have piano, violin, and flute, and we want to build something bigger. If you play an instrument or sing, we would love to hear from you.

Here is the deal: musicians who commit to the Sunday worship band can have an **allocated day to use the church space** for their own music projects, under supervision. It is a genuine exchange — you bring your gift on Sundays, and we give you space to work on yours.

### Sound Desk Volunteer

We also need a **Sound Desk Operator** for Sunday services. The setup has been simplified and full training is provided — no prior experience needed. If you are reliable and willing to learn, this is a great way to serve behind the scenes.

**Interested in joining the worship team?** [Get in touch]({{ '/contact/?subject=worship-team' | relative_url }}) — or if the sound desk is more your thing, [let us know]({{ '/contact/?subject=sound-desk' | relative_url }}). We will take it from there.
