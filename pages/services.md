## Sunday Morning Service

**Every Sunday at 10:30am**

Whether you are visiting for the first time or coming home, you are welcome. Our Sunday gathering is the heartbeat of our week — a time to worship together, hear from the Bible, pray, and encourage one another in faith.

Services run for approximately 45 to 60 minutes.

## What to Expect

When you arrive you will be greeted warmly at the door. There are no expectations and no dress code — just come as you are.

A typical Sunday morning looks like this:

- **Worship** — We sing together, accompanied by piano, violin, flute, and other instruments. Worship is a real highlight of our Sundays.
- **Teaching** — A message from the Bible, rooted in Scripture and applied to everyday life. We are currently exploring themes of character, faith, and following Jesus.
- **Prayer** — We value prayer together. There is space during the service to pray and to be prayed for.
- **Fellowship** — After the service, we gather for tea, coffee, and conversation. Some of the best moments happen here.

## Watch Live Online

Can't make it in person? We live-stream every Sunday service on Facebook. You can join from anywhere in the world — and many do. Friends have tuned in from across the UK and from as far as Liberia, West Africa.
