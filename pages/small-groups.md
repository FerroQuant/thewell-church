## Going Deeper Together

Sunday mornings are wonderful, but they are only part of the picture. Small groups are where real, lasting community is built — smaller gatherings of people who meet regularly through the week to study the Bible, pray, and do life together.

At The Well, we believe that following Jesus was never meant to be a solo journey. Small groups are an invitation to go deeper: deeper in your faith, deeper in your understanding of Scripture, and deeper in friendship with the people around you.

## Midweek Gatherings

We meet in homes and other venues across Reading throughout the week. These midweek gatherings are a chance to catch up, share what God has been putting on your heart, study the Bible together, and pray for one another.

You do not need to have everything figured out to join a group. Come as you are — questions welcome.

## Prayer Groups

Prayer is central to who we are as a church. Our prayer groups meet regularly to bring our needs, our hopes, and our community before God. We believe that prayer changes things, and we have seen God act in response to faithful, persistent prayer.

If you want to grow in prayer — or if you simply need people to pray with you — a prayer group might be exactly what you are looking for.

## Building Character Like Jesus — Devotional Study Groups

Our ongoing series, **Building Character Like Jesus**, is available as a group study as well as a daily personal devotional. The series explores what it looks like to grow in the character of Jesus, covering themes like:

- **Diligence** — Faithful effort in the small things
- **Compassion** — Seeing people the way Jesus sees them
- **Self-Control** — Living with wisdom and discipline
- **Joy** — A deep gladness rooted in God, not circumstances

These devotionals are shared daily on our Facebook page. Gathering with others to discuss and apply them adds another layer of richness and accountability.
