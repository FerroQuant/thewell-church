## Why Give?

Generosity is at the heart of what we believe. Everything we have is a gift from God, and giving is one of the ways we express our gratitude and our trust in him.

Your giving makes a real difference. It enables us to run our Sunday services, invest in children's and youth ministry, support The Well Centre's community work in Reading, and continue reaching people through our live-streamed services and daily devotionals online.

We have seen God provide faithfully, and we are grateful for every person who partners with us. Every gift — whatever its size — is received with genuine thankfulness.

> "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
>
> — 2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV)
